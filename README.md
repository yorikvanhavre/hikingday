HIKING DAY
==========

![screenshot](/textures/screenshot.jpg "screenshot")

A short game demo made with the blender game engine ( http://www.blender.org ). This was made in 5 days, so please excuse the poorly finished things...

You were hiking somewhere, on a nice summer day, when suddenly some rocks fall behind you...

INSTALL
-------

To install the game, simply download one of the complete versions from here:.

* Windows: http://www.4shared.com/zip/zZvDQYXY/hikingday_windows_32bits.html
* Linux 32bits: http://www.4shared.com/zip/f_vBQtXc/hikingday_linux_32bits.html
* Linux 64bits: http://www.4shared.com/zip/rFKGYMY0/hikingday_linux_64bits.html

Unzip it, and launch the "hikingday" application inside. Alternatively, or if your system doesn't appear in the builds, you can download the complete source here (there is a "download Zip" button on the right), and run the game from inside blender (menu Game -> Start game).

Note that the game requires a more or less good 3D chipset, otherwise it might run very slowly. It runs in 1920x1080 at 60fps with a geforce 660m, 30fps with intel i7, 15fps with a geforce 310m, and 8fps with intel i5...

You can speedup the game by opening the blend file in blender, untick the "Use desktop resolution" checkbox and reduce the resolution settings.

CONTROLS
--------

* W, A, S, D to move
* Space to jump
* Left click to grab / use
* Right click to show the map, once you found it
* F1 takes a screenshot and places it in the game folder
