HIKING DAY
==========

A short game demo made with the blender game engine ( http://www.blender.org ). This was made in 5 days, so please excuse the poorly finished things...

You were hiking somewhere, on a nice summer day, when suddenly some rocks fall behind you...

USAGE
-----

To play the game, you must first download the entire contents of this repository, and install blender on your machine. Then, open the .blend file and press "P" to run the game. Sorry, for now that's the only way. I plan to release standalone versions when I find how to do that properly.

CONTROLS
--------

* W, A, S, D to move
* Space to jump
* Left click to grab / use
* Right click to show the map, once you found it
* F1 takes a screenshot and places it in the game folder

CREDITS
